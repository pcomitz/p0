      This short project explores several famous Flatpick guitar payers. <em>Flatpicking</em>
      refers to a guitar playing style based on the use of a flatpick, sometimes referred to 
      as a plectrum. Flatpicking is usually associated with acoustic and bluegrass music. However
      flatpicking is prevalent in many other forms of music such as roots, americana, blues, 
      and other styles. In this site we take a quick look at 3 of foundational 
      flatpicking guitar players. These players established the style. This is style is 
      very popular and widely practiced today. In some ways all flatpickers are, consciously or 
      unconsciously copying the work of these players.
