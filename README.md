# Project 0 Paul Comitz


This project is a very brief description of flatpicking guitar playing. 

There are four pages as follows: 
1. Introduction (index.html) 
2. Guitar Player George Shuffler (gshuffler.html)
3. Guitar Player Clarence White (cwhite.html)
4. Guitar Player Tony Rice (trice.html)

Navigation is accomplished using the Bootstrap pagination class.

The css file is project0.css. The file is created using 
the sass command line utility on windows (note: a little more 
description of the use of this utility would have been useful. The 
installation info from the main sass page dos not seem correct. 
The incremental capabilities from sass where not very valuable in 
a small project like this.  

The sass variable, nesting, and inheritance are shown in the file 
project0sass.scss. Note: The sass file would not compile and flagged 
the error The target selector was not found" unless the inheritance, class and extends, were at the top of the scss file.  

The @media tag is used with the screen attribute. When the screen is 
less than 500 pixels wide, the background color is changed to lightgrey. 

The required youtube video is here:

Finally - it would be *extremely useful* to post a submission example. 
Submision using git is neither intuitive nor obvious. 

This compounded by the submit50 application. This application does not seem to run on windows: 
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'readline'

*Many, many, many* people use Windows. If the course does not support Windows users, please say so. 

Please consider covering essential details as part of the class. Thanks!
